### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

   Lab 3 is one of my favorite labs because it was the first lab where I personally started to learn how to code. I liked how the lab was straightforward in giving directions and was easy to understand. This was the lab in which I learned the difference between int and double as well as how to use std::cout and std::cin which paved the way for labs in the future.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 is one of my favorite labs because it was one of the first labs in which we used arguments. It set the blueprint for other labs to come because most of them used arguments or at least had something to do with them. I also got to learn how the game of blackjack works along with coding it which was cool.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 is one of my favorite labs becuase I really enjoyed coding the first part with my partner which was the Hi-Lo game. This was the lab where I really got used to using the if and else if statements. When looking over my Hi-Lo game code, I like how easy is was to read as well as how nicely it flowed from top to bottom which made it simple trace over and debug errors.
